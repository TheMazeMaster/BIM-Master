BIM Masterwheel – Master Build Specification (Written Outline)

🧭 Overview

The BIM Masterwheel is a fully modular, data-driven SVG visualization tool representing layered human instincts, behaviors, modifiers, and expressions across 7 concentric tiers (T0–T6). It emphasizes full user control, pixel-level alignment, and a clean separation of data, logic, and rendering. All values are explicitly declared; the engine performs no auto-inference.

🧱 Wheel Architecture

7 Tiers: T0 through T6, drawn center-out

globalDivisionCount: 132 (locked)

Rendering Order: T0 → T6

Draw Logic: Center-out, non-overlapping SVG segments

Rotation: Optional; user-controlled with multiple step options

🔧 Global Config Controls

globalDivisionCount: Total radial slices (132)

rotationStep: Defines snap angle per rotate button (based on 132 divisions)

rotationButtons: Configurable step list, e.g. -20, -3, +3, +20

debugRenderOutlines: Enables outline/stroke rendering for debug

debugGuides: Enables internal radial guides for dev use

strokeDefaults: Defines normal and wide line width globally

fontDefaults: Base font family and styling defaults


🎨 Color System

T3: Manual 10-color list (one per instinct block)

T4: 33 gradient pairs, defined via start/end hex codes

T5: mode: inherit from T4, with overlay: shade

T6: mode: inherit from T5, with overlay: tint

Transparent color: #00000000 or rgba(0,0,0,0)

Color palettes are defined in config.js for easy adjustment

🔁 Label and Font Logic

All tiers use a labelStyle config object

Supports centered (T0) and arcText or radial (T1–T6)

Font controls per tier: fontSize, fontWeight, anchor, verticalAlign

radiusOffset: Manual tweak value to fix arcText misalignment

All labels can be toggled with showLabels

🛠️ Stroke / Line Controls

Per-tier stroke object:

show: Toggles line rendering

normal, wide: Thickness settings

every: Applies wide stroke every N divisions

includeFirst: Ensures first line is always drawn

No stroke logic is inferred — full visual control

🎛️ Fill Modes

solid: Flat fill

gradient-global: Gradient across full ring

gradient-manual: One gradient per segment (T4 style)

manual: Per-segment color list (T3)

inherit: Uses prior tier’s color at same index (T5, T6)

🧩 Division Logic

divisionWeights[]: Every tier from T3–T6 uses manual arrays

T3 = 10 weighted instincts (weights sum to 132)

T4 = 33 behaviors × 4 divisions = 132

T5/T6 = 132 divisions

Slice angles are determined per tier by (weight / globalDivisionCount) × 360°, so higher
weights produce wider segments.

No calculations are auto-derived — all index math is hard-defined

🧠 Data Sources

labelList: Local list of strings or generated (e.g. T5 modifiers)

labelListSource: Used in T6 to dynamically switch datasets

availableSources: ["quotes", "emotion", "tone", "behavior", "thriveCounter"]

Data is modular — content can be swapped by toggling source

🧪 T6 Data Switching

T6 label set is dynamic

Button-style UI options allow live toggling between datasets

Entire dataset is pulled via labelListSource key

Each T6 state maps 1:1 with existing 132 segment structure

🔄 Rotation Modes

Rotation is optional, included in MVP

Rotation step values can be any integer from 1 to 132

Suggested default: -20, -3, +3, +20

All tiers (except T0–T2) rotate together

T0–T2 have rotationLocked: true

🖼️ Overlays

T4–T6 can include visual overlays via overlay block

Types: tint, shade

Applied per-tier (not global)

Optional radial overlay for global gradient (post-MVP)

✅ MVP Summary

Fully functioning 7-tier wheel

All tier configurations modular and isolated

Stroke + fill + label + font fully customizable per tier

Rotation logic clear and flexible

Data sources external and switchable

Overlay and color layers locked in for T4–T6
